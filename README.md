# Restaurant

## Explanation of the app
Restaurant is an app that will help users look at a restaurantâ€™s menu and view the details of the items in the menu. They are able to view the price of items, the description and an image as well. This information is retrieved from the following API: https://resto.mprog.nl/. In order to communicate elegantly with the API, the code to do this is contained in separate classes. This way the code that handles the UI will be separate from the code that retrieves data from the API.

## Implemented extra's
- I put some extra time in making the layout look nice, by making the price italic, the title bold and rescaling the images.

This extra is shown in the section "Screenshots of the app" (second image & third image).
