# Restaurant

## Explanation of the app
Restaurant is an app that will help users look at a restaurantâ€™s menu and view the details of the items in the menu. Of course, they must be able to view the price of items, the description and an image as well, all of which should be retrieved from an API. In order to communicate elegantly with the API, the code to do this will be contained in separate classes. This way the code that handles the UI will be separate from the code that retrieves data from the API.
